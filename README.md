Project:Dice_Roll_Generater 
Version 1.3.0

This is my first project. Its a dice roll generator that allows you to roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 sided die.
There is also a history section that tells you what die you rolled and the result.

Updates:
* Removed user input and instead allows for user to click on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 sided die roll buttons instead
    - previoius input method was to for the user to type in 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 for the program to generate 
    a random number
* changed standard windows Tkinter icon to a dice icon I got from:
    https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/role-playing_4261109?related_id=4258987&origin=search

Future Updates:
* plan to add a settings menu that allows useer to:
    - change the color theme of the program to some premade themes instead of pink
    - add a language selection menu using google traslate for the languages other than Arabic.
        - changes language from english to:
            - Arabic
            - Spanish
            - French 
            - Japanese
            - Chinese ( simplified Mandarin)
* plan to change the icon to a custom dice icon I will make myself instead
