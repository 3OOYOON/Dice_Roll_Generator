Project:Dice_Roll_Generater

This is my first project. Its a dice roll generator that allows you to roll a 
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 sided die.If your input isn't one of these numbers the 
generator will not run until you type in the correct number.There is also a history 
section that tells you what die you rolled and the result.
